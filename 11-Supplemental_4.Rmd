**Supplemental Figure 4**. Metyrapone administration does not alter open field behavior. (A) Mice were injected with 50 mg / kg metyrapone 30 minutes before a 10-minute open field test. (B) Representative heatmaps of movement during the 10-minute session. (C) There was no effect of Metyrapone on total distance traveled during the task, and (D) average velocity was also not impacted by metyrapone. Data presented as mean value +/- SEM.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning =FALSE}
data <- read_csv("Data/OFT.csv")
```

```{r}
t.test(Distance ~ Condition, data = data, var.equal = T)
```

```{r}
t.test(Velocity ~ Condition, data = data, var.equal = T)
```

Administration of 50 mg / kg metyrapone did not alter distance traveled in the open field (p = 0.29) or the average velocity of metyrapone-injected mice compared to saline-injected controls (p = 0.27; Figure S4).
