(A) Timeline of experimental procedures. Mice were injected with CFA and given 10 days to recover. Thirty minutes before a single TMT exposure, mice were injected with the TRPA-1 antagonist HC30031. (B) Raster plots of freezing behavior across the TMT session. (C) TRPA-1 antagonism normalizes circulating levels of corticosterone between pain-naive and CFA-primed mice. (D) TRPA-1 antagonism also normalizes levels of freezing during TMT exposure for CFA-primed mice. (E) Blockade of TRPA-1 signalling does not prevent the increase in freezing across the session. (F) Linear relationships between time spent with TMT and length of freezing episodes. (G) Density plots showing that TRPA-1 antagonism normalized the difference in length for freezing bouts. (H) Sensory responses after TMT in the left hind paws. (I) Sensory responses after TMT in the right hind paws. Data displayed as mean +/- SEM. *** indicates p &lt; 0.001. We administered the TRPA1 receptor antagonist HC30031 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) to CFA-primed and pain-naive mice 30 minutes before a single five-minute TMT exposure (Figure 6A). TRPA1 antagonism did not prevent TMT-induced freezing behavior (Figure 6B); mice still spent significantly more time freezing during the TMT session compared to a baseline session without TMT (t31 = 13.18 , p &lt; 0.001; data not shown). However, blocking TRPA1 receptors during TMT exposure occluded enhanced corticosterone release (p = 0.93; Figure 6C). b &lt;- data %&gt;% filter(Behavior == &quot;freeze&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(ID,Condition) %&gt;% summarise( sum=sum(Duration), Number=n(), ) %&gt;% mutate(Perc = (sum / 300)*100) %&gt;% mutate(Av_DUR = (sum / Number)) ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;ID&#39;.

VF measurements after TMT exposure indicated that TRPA-1 administration did not affect TMT-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in CFA-primed mice. TMT induced sensitivity across the time course (F4,70 = 13.04, p &lt; 0.001) that differed for pain-naive and CFA-primed mice (Left paws: F4,70 = 7.44, p &lt;0.001, Figure 6I; Right hind paws: F4,70 = 12.99, p &lt;0.001, Figure 6J). Specifically, mice with a history of CFA exhibited prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity in both hind paws after the five-minute encounter with TMT (all p &lt; 0.018 relative to baseline measurements). To test whether the noxious vehicle DMSO used to dilute HC30031 has any effects on behavioral outcomes, we injected mice with and without a history of injury with 10% DMSO 30 minutes before a five-minute TMT exposure (Figure S5). We found that CFA-primed mice treated with DMSO froze more during TMT than injury-naive DMSO-injected controls, and exhibited prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity afterwards. Together, these findings suggest that TRPA-1 antagonism blocks the enhancement in freezing during TMT that is caused by a history of CFA injury (Figure S6).
