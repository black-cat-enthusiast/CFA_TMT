**Figure 1. *A history of CFA injury enhances TMT-induced freezing behavior.*** (A) Timeline for behavioral testing: 10 Î¼L of 50% CFA injected into the footpad of the left hind paw was used as a model of injury, which produces a robust pain phenotype that reliably resolves within 7 days post-injection. Ten days after CFA, mice were tested for basal freezing levels and freezing during presentation of the single-molecule odor TMT. (B) Raster plots showing freezing behavior across the five-minute exposure to TMT. (C) CFA-primed mice spent more time freezing than pain-naive controls during TMT exposure. (D) Freezing behavior during each minute of TMT exposure. (E) Number of freezing episodes during TMT. (F) Linear relationship between time spent with TMT and length of freezing episodes. (G) Density plots showing the distribution of individual bouts of freezing compared between naive and CFA-primed mice. (H) Cumulative proportion of bouts of freezing during the TMT session. Data displayed as mean +/- SEM. \*\* indicates p \< 0.01, \*\*\* indicates p \< 0.001.

**Figure 2. *A history of injury facilitates chronification of TMT-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.*** (A) Timeline for behavioral testing: Naive for CFA-primed mice were exposed to TMT for five-minutes, and von Frey (VF) paw withdrawal thresholds were repeatedly measured to investigate TMT-induced alterations in sensory thresholds. (B) VF raw withdrawal thresholds after TMT in the previously injured hind paw. (C) VF paw withdrawal thresholds after TMT in the right (not injured) hindpaw. (D) VF paw withdrawal thresholds 60 days after the single exposure to TMT. (E) VF paw withdrawal thresholds 180 days after the single TMT session. (F) To further characterize the nature of the persistent hypersensitive phenotype, we used a 45 second hotplate test 70 days after the TMT exposure. (G) Raster plots showing nociceptive responses (e.g., shaking, flinching) during the hot plate test. (H) Latency to exhibit the first nociceptive response on the hot plate. (I) Mice with a history of injury spent more time exhibiting nociceptive responses. (J) The frequency of nociceptive behaviors on the hotplate was also higher for CFA-primed mice. (K) Cumulative frequency of nociceptive responses across the 45 second hot plate test. Data displayed as mean +/- SEM. \*\*\* indicates *p* \< 0.001.

**Figure 3. *Mice with a history of injury have higher levels of blood corticosterone after TMT exposure.*** (A) Timeline of experimental procedures. Mice were injected with CFA, allowed 10 days for their injury to recover, and were then exposed to TMT for 5 minutes. Either 30 or 60 minutes after TMT, trunk blood was collected. (B) Although there is no difference in basal levels of blood corticosterone, CFA-primed mice exhibited higher levels of circulating corticosterone at both 30 and 60 minutes after TMT. Data presented as mean +/- SEM. \* indicates *p* \< 0.05, \*\*\* indicates *p* \< 0.001.

**Figure 4. *Enhanced corticosterone production during TMT mediates chronification of mechanical hypersensitivity in CFA-primed mice.*** (A) Mice were injected with CFA and given 10 days to recover. 30 minutes before a single exposure to TMT, mice were injected with the corticosterone-synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (50 mg/kg). (B) Raster plots of freezing behavior during TMT exposure for metyrapone-treated mice. (C) Metrapone blocks freezing behavior during TMT and eliminates the group difference in freezing between CFA-primed and naive mice. (D) metyrapone blocks the increase in freezing across minutes with TMT. (E) There was no increase in the length of freezing episodes across the TMT session for metyrapone-treated mice. (F) Mechanical hypersensitivity after TMT in the left hindpaws. (G) Mechanical hypersensitivity after TMT in the right hidpaws.

**Figure 5. *Enhanced corticosterone production during TMT facilitates nociceptive responses on the hotplate among CFA-primed mice.*** (A) Timeline of experimental procedures. Mice were administered CFA and allowed 10 days to recover. Thirty minutes before a single exposure to TMT, mice were injected (i.p.) with 50 mg / kg metyrapone or Saline control. One week after the single exposure to TMT nociceptive responses during a 45-second exposure to a 52.5-degree hotplate were measured. (B) Raster plots of nociceptive responses during the hotplate test for saline-treated mice. (C) Latency to exhibit the first nociceptive response during testing. (D) CFA-primed mice spent more time exhibiting nociceptive responses, and (E) exhibited a higher frequency of nociceptive responses. (F) The cumulative frequency of nociceptive responses across the session. (G) Raster plots of nociceptive responses across the hotplate test for metyrapone-injected mice. (H) Latency to exhibit the first nociceptive response during the hotplate test. (I) Metraypone injection blocks the enhancing effect of CFA-priming on time spent exhibiting nociceptive behaviors on the hotplate, and (J) the frequency of nociceptive responses during the task. (K) Cumulative frequency of nociceptive responses for metyrapone-treated mice. Data displayed as mean value +/- SEM. \* indicates *p* \< 0.05.

**Figure 6. *Sensitization of TRPA1 signaling regulates enhanced circulating corticosterone and freezing during TMT among CFA-primed mice.*** (A) Timeline of experimental procedures. Mice were injected with CFA and given 10 days to recover. Thirty minutes before a single TMT exposure, mice were injected with the TRPA-1 antagonist HC30031. (B) Raster plots of freezing behavior across the TMT session. (C) TRPA-1 antagonism normalizes circulating levels of corticosterone between pain-naive and CFA-primed mice. (D) TRPA-1 antagonism also normalizes levels of freezing during TMT exposure for CFA-primed mice. (E) Blockade of TRPA-1 signalling does not prevent the increase in freezing across the session. (F) Linear relationships between time spent with TMT and length of freezing episodes. (G) Density plots showing that TRPA-1 antagonism normalized the difference in length for freezing bouts. (H) Sensory responses after TMT in the left hind paws. (I) Sensory responses after TMT in the right hind paws. Data displayed as mean +/- SEM. \*\*\* indicates *p* \< 0.001.

**Figure 7. *Proposed model of systems involved in behavioral responses to TMT.*** (A) Observed responses to TMT in pain-naive male mice. TMT induces two pharmacologically dissociable behavioral responses: Freezing behavior during the session and mechanical hypersensitivity after the exposure. The hormonal stress response entirely mediates freezing behavior, but corticosterone during TMT is not required for the expression of subsequent mechanical hypersensitivity. TRPA-1 signalling did not alter freezing behavior or mechanical sensitivity after TMT for naive mice, suggesting that, TMT induces mechanical hypersensitivity via corticosterone and TRPA-1-independent mechanisms (B) CFA-priming enhanced TMT-induced corticosterone levels, and this enhancement was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of TRPA-1 signalling. Together, these findings suggest that CFA-priming alters TRPA-1 signalling during TMT exposure to facilitate an enhanced corticosterone response, which causes enhanced freezing behavior during the session and a prolongation of mechanical sensitivity after the exposure.
