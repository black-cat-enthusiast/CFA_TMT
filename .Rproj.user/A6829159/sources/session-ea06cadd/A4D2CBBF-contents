**Figure 3. *Mice with a history of injury have higher levels of blood corticosterone after TMT exposure.*** (A) Timeline of experimental procedures. Mice were injected with CFA, allowed 10 days for their injury to recover, and were then exposed to TMT for 5 minutes. Either 30 or 60 minutes after TMT, trunk blood was collected. (B) Although there is no difference in basal levels of blood corticosterone, CFA-primed mice exhibited higher levels of circulating corticosterone at both 30 and 60 minutes after TMT. Data presented as mean +/- SEM. \* indicates *p* \< 0.05, \*\*\* indicates *p* \< 0.001.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data <- read_csv("Data/CORT_R.csv")

data$Pain <- as.character(data$Pain)
data$Pain <- factor(data$Pain,levels=unique(data$Pain))
```

## Overall Effects of Stress and Timepoint {-}

## Follow Ups: Effect of CFA at Each Timepoint {-}

```{r}
# Basal
a <- data %>%
  select(c("ID","Pain","Stress","CORT")) %>%
  filter(Stress == "Homecage")
  
t.test(CORT ~ Pain, data = a, var.equal = T)
```

Competitive ELISA results showed no significant difference in basal corticosterone levels between groups (p = 0.08).

```{r}
# 30 minutes after TMT
a <- data %>%
  select(c("ID","Pain","Stress","CORT")) %>%
  filter(Stress == "TMT_30")
  
t.test(CORT ~ Pain, data = a, var.equal = T)
```

```{r}
# 60 minutes after TMT
a <- data %>%
  select(c("ID","Pain","Stress","CORT")) %>%
  filter(Stress == "TMT_60")
  
t.test(CORT ~ Pain, data = a, var.equal = T)
```

However, both 30 and 60 minutes post-TMT, CFA-primed mice exhibited significantly higher circulating corticosterone levels compared to pain-naive controls (t14 = 3.82, p = 0.0018, t14 = 2.22, p = 0.043, respectively, Figure 3B).
