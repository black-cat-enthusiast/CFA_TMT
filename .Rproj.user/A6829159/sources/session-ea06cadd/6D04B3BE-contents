**Figure 1. *A history of CFA injury enhances TMT-induced freezing behavior.*** (A) Timeline for behavioral testing: 10 Î¼L of 50% CFA injected into the footpad of the left hind paw was used as a model of injury, which produces a robust pain phenotype that reliably resolves within 7 days post-injection. Ten days after CFA, mice were tested for basal freezing levels and freezing during presentation of the single-molecule odor TMT. (B) Raster plots showing freezing behavior across the five-minute exposure to TMT. (C) CFA-primed mice spent more time freezing than pain-naive controls during TMT exposure. (D) Freezing behavior during each minute of TMT exposure. (E) Number of freezing episodes during TMT. (F) Linear relationship between time spent with TMT and length of freezing episodes. (G) Density plots showing the distribution of individual bouts of freezing compared between naive and CFA-primed mice. (H) Cumulative proportion of bouts of freezing during the TMT session. Data displayed as mean +/- SEM. \*\* indicates p \< 0.01, \*\*\* indicates p \< 0.001.


```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE}
# Get data
data <- read_csv("Data/OG_CFA_TMT.csv")

# Clean up start times

start_times <- data[data$Behavior == "start", ]

number_of_behavs <- data %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n()
  )

data$dum <- rep(start_times$Start, number_of_behavs$n)
data$Start_clean <- data$Start - data$dum
data$Stop_clean <- data$Stop - data$dum

data$CFA <- factor(data$CFA,levels=unique(data$CFA))
data$PGE2 <- as.character(data$PGE2)
data$PGE2 <- factor(data$PGE2,levels=unique(data$PGE2))

# Remove groups not used in this manuscript
Exp_1_CFA.N <- data %>% 
  filter(PGE2 != "PGE2") %>%
  filter(CFA != "CFA_1D")
```

## Total amount of freezing during the session {-}

```{r}
b <- Exp_1_CFA.N  %>%
  filter(Behavior == "freeze") %>%
  group_by(ID,CFA) %>%
  summarise(
    sum=sum(Duration),
    Number=n(),
  ) %>%
  mutate(Perc = (sum / 300)*100)

t.test(Perc~CFA,data=b,var.equal=TRUE)
```

Across the 5-minute exposure to TMT, mice that had previously experienced CFA spent more time freezing than did pain naive controls (*t*(28) = 2.82, *p* = 0.009). 

## Frequency of Freezing During TMT{-}

```{r}
t.test(Number~CFA,data=b,var.equal=TRUE)
```

Overall, CFA-primed mice froze more frequently than naive mice (*t*(28) = 2.087, *p* = 0.046). 

## Linear relationship between time and length of freeze {-}

```{r}
# model the linear relationship between time and length of freeze
b <- lm(Duration~Start_clean * CFA, data=Exp_1_CFA.N)
summary(b)
```

The significant interaction between time and CFA indicates that the increase in length of freezing episode across the five-minute session differs for Naive and CFA-primed mice (p = 0.01). 

```{r}
Naives <- Exp_1_CFA.N[Exp_1_CFA.N$CFA == "Naive", ]
c <- lm(Duration~Start_clean, data = Naives)
summary(c)
```

For naive mice, a 1-second increase in time in the apparatus with TMT was associated with a 49.6 ms increase in predicted length of freeze. 

```{r}
CFAs <- Exp_1_CFA.N[Exp_1_CFA.N$CFA == "CFA", ]
d <- lm(Duration~Start_clean, data = CFAs)
summary(d)
```

For CFA-primed mice, a 1-second increase in time spent with TMT was associated with a 77.56 ms increase in predicted length of freeze. 

- The predicted second-by-second increase in freezing time was 56% greater than the predicted change for naive mice.


## Percent Freezing each minute {-}

Data binned by minute: 

```{r}
a <- Exp_1_CFA.N %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(Bins = cut(
    Start_clean,
    breaks = 5,
    labels=c("1","2","3","4","5")
  )) %>%
  group_by(ID, Behavior, CFA, PGE2, Bins) %>%
  summarise(
    sum = sum (Duration)
  ) %>%
  mutate(Perc = (sum / 60)*100 ) %>%
  filter(Behavior == "freeze")

anova <- aov(Perc~Bins*CFA,data=a)
summary(anova)
```

Freezing increased across the five minutes of exposure to TMT (F(4,134) = 22.59, p < 0.001), and CFA-primed mice froze more than naive controls (F(1,134) = 20.76, p < 0.001).

## Analysis of Distribution of Length of Freezing Bouts {-}

```{r, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(kSamples)

a <- data %>% 
  filter(CFA != "CFA_1D") %>%
  filter(PGE2 != "PGE2") %>%
  filter(Behavior == "freeze")

cfa_durations <- a$Duration[a$CFA == "CFA"]
naive_durations <- a$Duration[a$CFA == "Naive"]

ad.test(cfa_durations, naive_durations)
```

To compare the distribution of individual freezing episodes between CFA and Naive mice, an Anderson-Darling k-sample test was conducted. The test revealed a significant difference between the two distributions, (AD = 10.50, p < .001), indicating that mice with a history of CFA exhibited a shifted distribution of freezing duration compared to pain-naive mice.
