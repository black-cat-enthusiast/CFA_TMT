**Figure 5. *Enhanced corticosterone production during TMT facilitates nociceptive responses on the hotplate among CFA-primed mice.*** (A) Timeline of experimental procedures. Mice were administered CFA and allowed 10 days to recover. Thirty minutes before a single exposure to TMT, mice were injected (i.p.) with 50 mg / kg metyrapone or Saline control. One week after the single exposure to TMT nociceptive responses during a 45-second exposure to a 52.5-degree hotplate were measured. (B) Raster plots of nociceptive responses during the hotplate test for saline-treated mice. (C) Latency to exhibit the first nociceptive response during testing. (D) CFA-primed mice spent more time exhibiting nociceptive responses, and (E) exhibited a higher frequency of nociceptive responses. (F) The cumulative frequency of nociceptive responses across the session. (G) Raster plots of nociceptive responses across the hotplate test for metyrapone-injected mice. (H) Latency to exhibit the first nociceptive response during the hotplate test. (I) Metraypone injection blocks the enhancing effect of CFA-priming on time spent exhibiting nociceptive behaviors on the hotplate, and (J) the frequency of nociceptive responses during the task. (K) Cumulative frequency of nociceptive responses for metyrapone-treated mice. Data displayed as mean value +/- SEM. \* indicates *p* \< 0.05.

## Effect of CFA for Saline-Treated Mice {-}

```{r}
a <- LE_data %>%
  group_by(ID,CFA) %>%
  filter(Behavior == "shake/flick") %>%
  filter(Drug == "Saline") %>%
  summarise(
    min=min(Start_clean)
  )

t.test(data = a, min ~ CFA, var.equal = T)
```

We also investigated whether metyrapone administration prior to TMT exposure would alter nociceptive behaviors on the hotplate in CFA-primed mice. One week after a single TMT exposure, mice were tested on a 52.5 degree hotplate for 45 seconds (Figure 5A). Although there was no group difference in latency to the first nociceptive response (p = 0.91, Figure 5B, C), 

```{r}
data <- LE_data %>%
  filter(Behavior == "shake/flick") 

## Saline-treated
saline <- data %>% 
  filter(Drug == "Saline")

a <- saline %>%
  group_by(ID,CFA) %>%
  summarize(
    sum=sum(Duration)
  )

t.test(sum ~ CFA, data = a, var.equal = T)
```


CFA-primed mice that were administered a saline vehicle 30 minutes before TMT spent more time exhibiting nociceptive responses on the hotplate (t20 = 2.4, p = 0.026, Figure 5D), 

```{r}
a <- saline %>%
  group_by(ID,CFA) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n()
  )

t.test(n ~ CFA, data = a, var.equal = T)
```

and a higher frequency of nociceptive responses (t20 = 2.22, p = 0.038, Figure 5E, F). 

## No Effect of CFA for Metyrapone-Treated Mice {-}

```{r}
mety <- data %>%
  filter(Drug == "Metyrapone")

a <- mety %>%
  group_by(ID,CFA) %>%
  summarize(
    sum=sum(Duration)
  )

t.test(sum ~ CFA, data = a, var.equal = T)

a <- mety %>%
  group_by(ID,CFA) %>%
  summarise(
    n=n()
  )

t.test(n ~ CFA, data = a, var.equal = T)
```

In contrast, no group differences in hotplate behavior were observed between CFA-primed and pain-naive mice treated with metyrapone prior to TMT exposure (all p > 0.87, Figure 5G-K).
