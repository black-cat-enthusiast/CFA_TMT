**Figure 2. *A history of injury facilitates chronification of TMT-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.*** (A) Timeline for behavioral testing: Naive for CFA-primed mice were exposed to TMT for five-minutes, and von Frey (VF) paw withdrawal thresholds were repeatedly measured to investigate TMT-induced alterations in sensory thresholds. (B) VF raw withdrawal thresholds after TMT in the previously injured hind paw. (C) VF paw withdrawal thresholds after TMT in the right (not injured) hindpaw. (D) VF paw withdrawal thresholds 60 days after the single exposure to TMT. (E) VF paw withdrawal thresholds 180 days after the single TMT session. (F) To further characterize the nature of the persistent hypersensitive phenotype, we used a 45 second hotplate test 70 days after the TMT exposure. (G) Raster plots showing nociceptive responses (e.g., shaking, flinching) during the hot plate test. (H) Latency to exhibit the first nociceptive response on the hot plate. (I) Mice with a history of injury spent more time exhibiting nociceptive responses. (J) The frequency of nociceptive behaviors on the hotplate was also higher for CFA-primed mice. (K) Cumulative frequency of nociceptive responses across the 45 second hot plate test. Data displayed as mean +/- SEM. \*\*\* indicates *p* \< 0.001.



**Figure 4. *Enhanced corticosterone production during TMT mediates chronification of mechanical hypersensitivity in CFA-primed mice.*** (A) Mice were injected with CFA and given 10 days to recover. 30 minutes before a single exposure to TMT, mice were injected with the corticosterone-synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (50 mg/kg). (B) Raster plots of freezing behavior during TMT exposure for metyrapone-treated mice. (C) Metrapone blocks freezing behavior during TMT and eliminates the group difference in freezing between CFA-primed and naive mice. (D) metyrapone blocks the increase in freezing across minutes with TMT. (E) There was no increase in the length of freezing episodes across the TMT session for metyrapone-treated mice. (F) Mechanical hypersensitivity after TMT in the left hindpaws. (G) Mechanical hypersensitivity after TMT in the right hidpaws.
