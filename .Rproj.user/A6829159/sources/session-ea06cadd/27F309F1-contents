**Supplemental Figure 1**. Time course of hypersensitivity and injury resolution after CFA administration. (A) CFA induces mechanical sensitivity at the site of injury. (B) CFA administration to the left paw did not produced changes in sensitivity in the contralateral paw. Data displayed as mean value +/- SEM.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data <- read_csv("Data/Revisions_VF_R.csv")
data$CFA <- factor(data$CFA, levels = c("Naive", "CFA"))
```

## Raw VF Values {-}

### Left Paws {-}

```{r}
a <- data[data$Paw == "Left", ]
anova_test(data = a, dv=VF,wid=ID,between=CFA,within=Test,effect.size = "pes")

a %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Test) %>%
  pairwise_t_test(VF~CFA)
```

CFA administration caused mechanical hypersensitivity in the week after injection F~~3,90~~ = 68.88, p <0.001. CFA-treated mice had significantly lower paw withdrawal thresholds one and five days after injection (both p < 0.001), but the group difference in sensitivity had resolved by the eighth day after injection (p = 0.249). 

### Right Paws {-}

```{r}
a <- data[data$Paw == "Right", ]
anova_test(data = a, dv=VF,wid=ID,between=CFA,within=Test,effect.size = "pes")

a %>%
  dplyr::group_by(Test) %>%
  pairwise_t_test(VF~CFA)
```

There was no effect of CFA treatment on VF thresholds for the right (non-injected) hindpaws across days of testing (p = 0.74)

## Within-Subjects' Changes in VF Threasholds {-}

```{r}
a <- data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Test, values_from = VF) %>%
  mutate(percBL_1D = (`CFA + 1D` / Baseline) * 100,
         percBL_5D = (`CFA + 5D` / Baseline) * 100,
         percBL_8D = (`CFA + 8D` / Baseline) * 100,
         Baseline = 100) %>%
  select(ID, Paw, CFA, Baseline, percBL_1D, percBL_5D, percBL_8D)

colnames(a) <- c("ID","Paw","CFA","Baseline","CFA + 1D", "CFA + 5D", "CFA + 8D")
```


### Left Paws {-}

```{r}
b <- a  %>%
  melt(id.vars = c("ID", "Paw", "CFA")) %>%
  filter(Paw == "Left") %>%
  ungroup() 

anova_test(data = b, dv = value, within = variable, between = CFA, wid = ID)

b %>%
  group_by(CFA) %>%
  pairwise_t_test(value~variable, paired = T)
```

CFA induced significant changes in VF thresholds across the time course F~~3,90~~ = 67.57, p < 0.001. CFA-treated mice exhibited significant decreases in their paw withdrawal thresholds, relative to their baseline measurements, both one and five days after injection (both p < 0.001). CFA-treated mice did not exhibit ongoing sensitivity eight  days after CFA injection, indicating that the injury had resolved (p = 0.464).

### Right Paws {-}

```{r}
b <- a %>%
  melt(id.vars = c("ID", "Paw", "CFA")) %>%
  filter(Paw == "Right") %>%
  ungroup()

anova_test(data = b, dv = value, within = variable, between = CFA, wid = ID)
```

There were no within-subjects changes in paw withdrawal thresholds for the right (non-injured) paws (p = 0.57).
