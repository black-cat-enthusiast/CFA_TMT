A history of CFA injury enhances TMT-induced freezing behavior. (A) Timeline for behavioral testing: 10 μL of 50% CFA injected into the footpad of the left hind paw was used as a model of injury, which produces a robust pain phenotype that reliably resolves within 7 days post-injection. Ten days after CFA, mice were tested for basal freezing levels and freezing during presentation of the single-molecule odor TMT. (B) Raster plots showing freezing behavior across the five-minute exposure to TMT. (C) CFA-primed mice spent more time freezing than pain-naive controls during TMT exposure.

We found that mice did not exhibit freezing behavior or mechanical hypersensitivity after butyric acid exposure (Figure S3), highlighting that the behavioral responses to TMT represent a specific fear response, and are not related to the other elements of the testing procedures.

TMT induced sensitivity across the time course (F4,70 = 13.04, p &lt; 0.001) that differed for pain-naive and CFA-primed mice (Left paws: F4,70 = 7.44, p &lt;0.001, Figure 6I; Right hind paws: F4,70 = 12.99, p &lt;0.001, Figure 6J). Specifically, mice with a history of CFA exhibited prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity in both hind paws after the five-minute encounter with TMT (all p &lt; 0.018 relative to baseline measurements). To test whether the noxious vehicle DMSO used to dilute HC30031 has any effects on behavioral outcomes, we injected mice with and without a history of injury with 10% DMSO 30 minutes before a five-minute TMT exposure (Figure S5). We found that CFA-primed mice treated with DMSO froze more during TMT than injury-naive DMSO-injected controls, and exhibited prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity afterwards. Together, these findings suggest that TRPA-1 antagonism blocks the enhancement in freezing during TMT that is caused by a history of CFA injury (Figure S6). "],["figure-7.html", "Figure 7", " Figure 7 Figure 7. Proposed model of systems involved in behavioral responses to TMT. (A) Observed responses to TMT in pain-naive male mice. TMT induces two pharmacologically dissociable behavioral responses: Freezing behavior during the session and mechanical hypersensitivity after the exposure. The hormonal stress response entirely mediates freezing behavior, but corticosterone during TMT is not required for the expression of subsequent mechanical hypersensitivity. TRPA-1 signalling did not alter freezing behavior or mechanical sensitivity after TMT for naive mice, suggesting that, TMT induces mechanical hypersensitivity via corticosterone and TRPA-1-independent mechanisms (B) CFA-priming enhanced TMT-induced corticosterone levels, and this enhancement was blocked by pharmacological inhibition of TRPA-1 signalling. Together, these findings suggest that CFA-priming alters TRPA-1 signalling during TMT exposure to facilitate an enhanced corticosterone response, which causes enhanced freezing behavior during the session and a prolongation of mechanical sensitivity after the exposure. The current results give rise to several novel insights about responses to TMT and modulation by prior experience with pain. Specifically, our findings indicate that TMT induces two pharmacologically dissociable behavioral responses: Freezing and mechanical hypersensitivity (Figure 7A). The hormonal stress response entirely mediates freezing, whereas hypersensitivity after TMT persists even when the stress response is blocked. CFA-primed mice exhibit enhanced freezing and corticosterone release during TMT presentation, and prolonged sensitivity afterward. The freezing response can be entirely blocked by inhibition of glucocorticoid synthesis, and antagonism of TRPA-1 signaling normalized both freezing and circulating corticosterone among mice with a history of CFA injury (Figure 7B). These findings suggest that CFA-priming regulates TRAP-1 signaling to enhance threat-induced corticosterone release and the associated behavioral output - freezing. The enhanced hormonal stress response also modulated the prolongation of mechanical sensitivity after TMT without preventing TMT-induced hypersensitivity.
