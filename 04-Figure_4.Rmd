**Figure 4. *Enhanced corticosterone production during TMT mediates chronification of mechanical hypersensitivity in CFA-primed mice.*** (A) Mice were injected with CFA and given 10 days to recover. 30 minutes before a single exposure to TMT, mice were injected with the corticosterone-synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (50 mg/kg). (B) Raster plots of freezing behavior during TMT exposure for metyrapone-treated mice. (C) Metrapone blocks freezing behavior during TMT and eliminates the group difference in freezing between CFA-primed and naive mice. (D) metyrapone blocks the increase in freezing across minutes with TMT. (E) There was no increase in the length of freezing episodes across the TMT session for metyrapone-treated mice. (F) Mechanical hypersensitivity after TMT in the left hindpaws. (G) Mechanical hypersensitivity after TMT in the right hidpaws.

## Time Spent Freezing Behavior During TMT {-}

Next, we administered the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor metyrapone to CFA-primed and pain-naive mice 30 minutes before a single five-minute TMT exposure to determine whether the hormonal stress response is necessary for TMT-induced freezing or mechanical hypersensitivity (Figure 4A). 

```{r}
b <- data  %>%
  filter(Behavior == "freeze") %>%
  group_by(ID,Condition) %>%
  summarise(
    sum=sum(Duration),
    Number=n(),
  ) %>%
  mutate(Perc = (sum / 300)*100) %>%
  mutate(Av_DUR = (sum / Number))

t.test(Perc~Condition,data=b,var.equal=TRUE)
```

Although metryapone does not alter general locomotor behavior in an open field (Figure S4), inhibition of corticosterone synthesis prevented TMT-induced freezing (Figure 4B) and eliminated the group differences in freezing between CFA-primed and pain-naive mice (p = 0.17, Figure 4C).

```{r}
a <- data %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(Bins = cut(
    Start_clean,
    breaks = 5,
    labels=c("1","2","3","4","5")
  )) %>%
  group_by(ID, Behavior, Condition, Bins) %>%
  filter(Behavior == "freeze")

anova <- aov(Duration~Bins*Condition,data=a)
summary(anova)
```

Blocking the hormonal stress response also prevented the expected increase in freezing over the five-minute TMT exposure (p = 0.33, Figure 4D)

```{r}
x <- data %>%
  filter(Duration < 4)

b <- lm(Duration~Start_clean * Condition, data=x)
summary(b)
```

and the extension of freezing episode duration across the session (p = 0.30, Figure 4E).

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
VF_data <- read_csv("Data/Met_TMT_VF_R.csv")

VF_data$Condition <- as.character(VF_data$Condition)
VF_data$Condition <- factor(VF_data$Condition, levels=unique(VF_data$Condition))

IDs = VF_data[,1:2]

L_data <- VF_data[ ,c(3,5,7,9,11)]
L_data <- cbind(IDs,L_data)

a <- L_data %>%
  melt(id.vars = c("ID","Condition")) 

my_labs <- c("Baseline","3 hours", "1 day", "3 days", "7 days")


R_data <- VF_data[ ,c(4,6,8,10,12)]
R_data <- cbind(IDs,R_data)

b <- R_data %>%
  melt(id.vars = c("ID","Condition")) 
```

## Raw VF scores {-}

```{r}
# Left paws
L_res <- aov(value ~ variable * Condition, data = a)
summary(L_res)
```

```{r}
# Right paws
R_res <- aov(value ~ variable * Condition, data = b)
summary(R_res)
```

Despite the complete absence of TMT-induced freezing among metyrapone-treated mice, both CFA-primed and pain-naive mice exhibited significant bilateral mechanical hypersensitivity after TMT exposure (Left hindpaws: F4,70 = 69.18, p < 0.0001, Figure 4F; Right hindpaws: F4,70 = 74.42, p < 0.0001, Figure 4G). 

## VF Thresholds Relative to Baseline Measurements {-}

```{r}
# Left paws 
a %>%
  group_by(Condition) %>%
  pairwise_t_test(value ~ variable, p.adjust.method = "fdr")

# Right paws
b %>%
  group_by(Condition) %>%
  pairwise_t_test(value ~ variable, p.adjust.method = "fdr")
```

CFA-primed mice showed resolution of TMT-induced mechanical hypersensitivity within one week post-exposure (naive: both paws p > 0.27 relative to baseline measurements; CFA-primed: both paws p > 0.63), suggesting that the exaggerated hormonal stress response during TMT modulates the persistence of TMT-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity among mice with a history of CFA injury.
